# Notes

## Git
- Use git diff to see the differences between commits
- Reference a branch *n* commits ago with *branch*~*n*
- Forking is like cloning a repo except it copies it to your GitHub instead of your local machine

## deployFiles.sh
- Host argument must be of the format "domain.tld" or just the ip address.
